- Cypress offers two options: end-to-end and component tests.

                                COMPONENT TESTS:

- differ from end-to-end tests in that instead of visiting a URL to pull up an entire app, 
  a component can be "mounted" and tested on its own. This allows you to focus on testing only 
  the component's functionality and not worrying about other nuances with testing a component as 
  part of the larger application.
- Even if all your component tests pass, it does not mean your app is functioning properly. 
  Component tests do nothing to ensure that all the layers of your app are working well together.
  Hence we need end to end testing.
- Does not need any CI infrastructure.
- Command used: cy.mount(<MyComponent />)

                                END TO END TESTS:

- E2E Testing is a technique that tests your app from the web browser through to the back end of your 
  application, as well as testing integrations with third-party APIs and services. These types of tests 
  are great at making sure your entire app is functioning as a cohesive whole.
- Command used: cy.visit(url)
