CASE: mouseover and mouseout issue
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
a color gets changed on mouseover but when we take mouse away from it
in inspect, the color changes since mouseout event is triggered.

WORKAROUND:
in console write
setTimeOut(() => {debugger;}, 3000);
hit enter

and do hovering or searching (autosuggest)

debugger gets triggered after 3 seconds and everything PAUSES, we can now get
locator

CASE: Autosearch dissappears and we need debugger as per our control
although timeout is more reliable way
For cases without mouseout issue, 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
go to sources >> snippets >> create new snippet
write -> debugger;

bring desired state in DOM and right click in this script file here and run
everything pauses and we can now get locator.
